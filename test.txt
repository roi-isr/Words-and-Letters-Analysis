Hello Github ,
This is a tutorial of words and letters analysis of a project in Python programming language I made by myself. You can watch it and learn from it.
I will upload this project to Github in the near future.
Fell free to make an opinion about this project. Any advice is welcome.
Thank you very much ! It was fun coding this !

=> All written in this file is a trial for the words and letters analysis.
